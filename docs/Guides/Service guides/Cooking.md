##  Understanding Nutrition =
In Unitystation, every character has a nutrition value that determines how full their stomach is. The nutrition value goes from 1 to 500, and every character has 400 nutrition at the start of a round. You will receive different messages in the chat log and possibly effects depending on how much nutrition you have.

* 500 Nutrition: "You're stuffed!", you won't be able to eat any more food at this point.
* 300 Nutrition: "You're satiated.", no effect.
* 200 Nutrition: "You feel hungry.", no effect.
* 100 Nutrition: "Your stomach rumbles violently.", no effect.
* 000 Nutrition: "Your malnourished body aches!", you start to slow down!

You will gradually lose nutrition over time, though different actions cause different amounts of nutrition loss. Running around will cause you to go hungrier faster than walking around or staying still.

## How to cook
Currently, the cooking system in Unitystation has relatively few possible operations:
###Mixing
  You can mix ingredients together in a vessel (most likely your mixing bowl) to produce new ingredients.
  Holding a bowl in hands or on the table, click it with item you want to add in hand. Reaction will occur instantaneously,
  consuming ingredients and keeping the result in a bowl or dropping it on the floor, if it's an item.
###Crafting
  Currently, crafting only works by combining one item in your hand with the item in another hand. Burgers,
  for an example, are made this way.
###Microwaving
  Several dishes can be boiled, fried or heated in a microvave. For that, put the ingredient in a microwave,
  and turn it on by pressing a green button. Microwave can be adjusted for time, but that does nothing at the moment.
###Slicing
  To cut a dish or a piece of dough into smaller pieces, hold the item in one hand, then, click on it with a knife.
###Grinding
  To produce flour and ketchup, you would have to use the All-in-one Grinder. To do so, first, load in the raw items you want to grind,
  and then click on it holding the container you want to put your items into.
